function [ H ] = ransacHomography( x1, x2, thresh )
%   RANSACHOMOGRAPHY Summary of this function goes here
%From two sets of points x1 and x2,it selects randomly some 'chose' 
%number of indices and finds the homography matrix with the points
%in the set x1 and x2 cooresponding to these indices

%   Detailed explanation goes here
%   The points in p1 and p2 correspond to same indices in x1 and
%   x2,repectively.g_h is the homography matrix obtained from the point
%   sets p1 and p2.'max_score' stores the maximum score corresponding
%   homography matrix so far
